* Building the container image

#+begin_src sh
sudo apptainer build [path where image should be placed]/trireme.sif trireme.def
#+end_src

* Working with CSR on SuiteSparse matrices

SuiteSparse matrices are provided in COO format (.mtx files) or CSC format (.rb files) by default.
Converting them to CSR using scipy.sparse (as implemented in this repo) requires significant memory and is best done offline, before running benchmarks.
On the experiment system—an i9-12900K with 128GB RAM (its maximum capacity)—these transformations will require swap space.

See [[./convert_ss_to_csr.sh]] for details.

* Running tests

Use one worker thread, some modules are not thread safe
#+begin_src sh
lit -j1 -a tests
#+end_src

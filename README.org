* Building the container image

The project uses [[https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/quick_start.html][Apptainer]] for containerized environment management based on Ubuntu 22.04.
Build the container image using:

#+begin_src sh
sudo apptainer build [path where image should be placed]/trireme.sif trireme.def
#+end_src

For a native installation you may try following the steps in [[file:trireme.def][trireme.def]]

* Usage

The three main entry points are:
- [[file:spmv.py][spmv.py]]
- [[file:spmm.py][spmm.py]]
- [[file:suite_sparse.py][suite_sparse.py]]

Example use cases can be found in tests/
To run all tests:
#+begin_src sh
lit -j1 -a tests
#+end_src

* System Configuration

The [[file:run_experiment.sh][run_experiment.sh]] script provides a comprehensive system configuration for consistent performance measurements on an Alderlake E-core.
It performs the following optimizations:

CPU Configuration
- Turbo Boost: Disables Intel Turbo Boost to ensure consistent CPU frequencies
- HWP (Hardware P-States): Manages Intel P-state driver configuration
- Performance Governor: Sets CPU frequency scaling governor to "performance" mode
- Fixed Frequency: Locks CPU cores to maximum frequency to eliminate frequency scaling effects
- Uncore Frequency: Sets uncore (cache/memory controller) frequency to maximum
- Deep Idle States: Disables deep CPU idle states to reduce wake-up latency

#### Memory Configuration
- ASLR: Disables Address Space Layout Randomization for consistent memory layout
- Swap Prevention: Configures `vm.overcommit_memory=0` and `vm.swappiness=0` to prevent swapping
- Memory Isolation: Ensures cores are isolated from kernel scheduling

* Working with CSR on SuiteSparse matrices

SuiteSparse matrices are provided in COO format (.mtx files) or CSC format (.rb files) by default.
Converting them to CSR using scipy.sparse (as implemented in this repo) requires significant memory and is best done offline, before running benchmarks.
On the experiment system—an i9-12900K with 128GB RAM (its maximum capacity)—these transformations will require swap space.

See [[./convert_ss_to_csr.sh]] for details.
